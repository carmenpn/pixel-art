# Pixel Art Maker Project

One of my first projects while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, part of the Udacity Google Scholarship.

## How do I open it?

Open the html file into your favorite browser and color whatever your heart desires. 

## How does it work?

This projects is a Pixel Art Project, which means you can pick any canvas you want, choose any color you want and play away. 
If you mess something up, don't worry. You can double click on that cell and the color will disappear. Besides, you have a full spectrum of colors, so don't be shy. 
Changed your mind about the picture you want to paint? No worries. Hit the Reset button and you can start over.
Have fun!
